Subject: VinylFunders - Business Model Clarification (Not Crowdfunding)

Dear Stripe Support,

I'm writing to clarify VinylFunders' business model following concerns about crowdfunding compliance.

VinylFunders is a legitimate music marketplace specializing in vinyl pre-orders, NOT a crowdfunding platform. Key distinctions:

**Our Business Model:**
• Vinyl pre-orders with guaranteed manufacturing (similar to Bandcamp, Qrates)
• Fixed pricing - customers know exactly what they're purchasing
• Established manufacturing partnerships with verified pressing plants
• Standard industry practice for vinyl production (8-12 week manufacturing cycle)

**Payment Processing:**
• Use Stripe's authorization/capture model (standard e-commerce practice)
• Payments authorized immediately, captured only when manufacturing begins
• Automatic refunds if minimum quantities aren't met (100/200/500 units)
• Maximum 90-day authorization period (within Stripe guidelines)

**Compliance & Protection:**
• Registered business with proper licensing
• Professional order fulfillment and customer service
• Clear terms of service and transparent pricing
• PCI DSS compliant with proper security measures
• Established dispute resolution processes

**Key Differentiators from Crowdfunding:**
• No speculative projects - only confirmed, producible albums
• No variable funding goals or backer rewards
• Professional manufacturing timelines, not uncertain project delivery
• Fixed product pricing with guaranteed delivery

VinylFunders operates identically to established platforms like Bandcamp and Qrates, which successfully process millions in vinyl pre-orders annually. We're committed to maintaining the highest compliance standards and can provide any additional documentation needed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
